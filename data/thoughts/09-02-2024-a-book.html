        V for the Vietnamese and A for the American <br>
        V: Wanna go buy plants together?<br>
        A: , said the vietnamese to the american. An excerpt from the upcoming children's book, 
        "let's be friends and let the past be the past"<br>
        V: I love the name of the book already :3 of course, I love you much more than the act
        of holding onto the troubling past<br>
        A: It starts with a white one and yellow one walking into the jungle to look for plants...
        Then the other one reemerges alone, holding a beautiful new plant. "Two birds, one stone" <br>
        The more of the story is, if you need to take care of some business, do it in the jungle <br>
        V: Like grenading people when they pee? <br>
        A: Trip wiring roots of pretty orchids actually <br>
        V: That too

      R for the Rabbit and S for the Sheep <br>
      S: Free-range or barn-raised rabbit ?<br>
      R: Free-range, of course. You know they both end up in the
      rabbit stew right?<br>
      S: It's the journey that counts.<br>
      Live a life as a legend, eating clover and banging other 
      free rabbits, or suffer in a cage. But yes, the stew is 
      the only absolute. <br>
      <br>
      Keep your faith, don't stop believing.

      To juli, I know someday we'll create something together that's close to our hearts. I don't know
      what it'll be but it's gonna be good. I just know that.

      There is something about the German word ,heimatlos' that just makes me feel 2 octaves lower.
      Way too precise, way too poignant, ... It hits where it hurts.
      <li>About being a vessel</li>
      <br>

      As I'm just a collection of quantum particles and their interactions that change constantly,
      there is, inherently, no self. Material and energy are continuously exchanged with the
      surroundings so what sense am I still me? And in what sense was it ever me? I'm just a vessel
      for Motherboard. So much that we take so seriously is completely devoid of any meaning...
      But it's fine to still say I like the color blue or aquatic animals or high-dimensional space. 
      I accept that, I can live with that; actually, I celebrate it. That's what makes life 
      beautiful and wonderful. It just means I don't hold onto anything so tightly. After all,
      I'm just a vessel. Being becomes so light that it is unbearable.
