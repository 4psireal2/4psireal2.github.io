      <li> The pear was now acutely aware of its peariness, and not denying this altogether, hope that perhaps it was a particular kind of pear.
           Particular enough to discover the purpose amongst all these encounters with people.

           One day, quite bespeckled as it now was, the pear had changed immensely. No beige-green spot was to be found any longer anywhere on its body.
           This transformation was partly what we could see on the outside, but much more had happened inside - where human touch had gone deepest - and 
           made the pear vulnerable. One of these speckles that went deep inside caught a yeast, turning the pear into cheap schnapps and killing it.
           Yeast's a bitch. Peace
