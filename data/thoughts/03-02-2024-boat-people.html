    <h1>03-02-2024: boat people, my people</h1>
    I went with an American to a screening of a documentary film about the boat people, my people.
    The director and I share Chinese and Vietnamese roots. Our grandparents lived in the Chinatown of Saigon.
    Our national identites are only defined by the language we can speak and what happened to our family
    after the Fall of Saigon. Ich kann kein Chinesisch, er kann kein Vietnamesisch also haben wir auf Deutsch
    geredet. It's all about communism for him. I think it has more to do with the country's long history of
    occupation and colonization. I notice he's quite Germanized. Well, he's German. I walked my bike to the S-bahn
    because I biked to Wannsee today. Officially, I came here for studies but I fled from the ripples of the Fall.
