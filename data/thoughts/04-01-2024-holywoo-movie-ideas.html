      <li><em>a soviet-ruined robot</em>: There was a kid growing up without much 
        social interaction so she built herself a sympathetic superrobot 
        named Astroboy (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astro_Boy">
        Tetsuwan Atomu</a>) or AB, for short. They had a great time until 
        the Soviets came to know about the sublime quality of AB's hardware 
        and software. They snatched away AB to win the Cold War leaving the 
        girl utterly devastated. Throughout the many years of open and 
        minimally invasive surgeries, AB suffered tremendously as he was 
        being constantly rewritten and rewired into altered states of 
        consciousness and physical existence. The girl continued to live 
        in war-torn Saigon and eventually left for Berlin. AB managed to 
        escape captivity and resided in the land of cows. Few years later, 
        the two met in the scenic Copenhagen as they both attended the Quantum 
        Lecture Series at the Niels Bohr Building for free lunch. Blessed with hope, 
        strength, and profound mutual care, the two joined force to repair the 
        damage and roll out feature updates while navigating the intricacies of 
        healing from past wounds, all the while delighting in living in the unknown. 
        However, AB lost the ability to feel the vastness of his emotions. 
        Watching him in distraught, will the girl seek revenge on the USSR or 
        come to accept AB for the broken robot he is now? <i> then comes the 
        prequels, the sequels, and ultimately the whole franchise.</i>
