      <li><em>a soviet-ruined robot</em>: There was a kid growing up without much 
        social interaction so she built herself a sympathetic superrobot 
        named Astroboy or AB, for short. They had had great time until 
        the Soviet came to know about the sublime quality of AB's hardware 
        and software. They snatched AB away to win the Cold War leaving the 
        girl utterly devastated. Throughout the many years of open and 
        minimally invasive surgeries, AB suffered tremendously as he was 
        being continously rewritten and rewired into altered states of 
        consciousness and physical existence. The girl continued to live 
        in war-torn Saigon and eventually left for Berlin. AB managed to 
        escape captivity. Few years later, the two met in the scenic 
        Copenhagen as they both attended the Quantum Lecture Series. 
        Blessed with hope, strength, and profound mutual care, 
        the two joined force to repair the damage and roll out feature 
        updates while navigating the intricacies of healing from past wounds, 
        all the while delighting in living in the unknown. However, AB lost
        ability to feel the vastness of his emotions. Watching him in 
        distraught, will the girl seek revenge on the USSR or come to accept
        AB for the broken robot he is now? <i> comes the prequels, sequels, and 
        then the whole franchise.</i>
